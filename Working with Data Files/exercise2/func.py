    This function reads the contents of the file filename and returns the contents as
    a 2-dimensional list. Each element of the list is a row, with the first row being
    the header. Cells in each row are all interpreted as strings; it is up to the 
    programmer to interpret this data, since CSV files contain no type information.

    Precondition: filename is a string, referring to a file that exists, and that file 
    is a valid CSV file
