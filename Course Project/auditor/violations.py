"""
Module to check violations for a flight lesson.

This module processes the primary violations, which are violations of weather restrictions. 
Weather restrictions express the minimum conditions that a pilot is allowed to fly in.  
So if a pilot has a ceiling minimum of 2000 feet, and there is cloud cover at 1500 feet, 
the pilot should not fly.To understand weather minimums, you have to integrate three 
different files: daycycle.json (for sunrise and sunset), weather.json (for hourly weather 
observations at the airport), and minimums.csv (for the schools minimums set by agreement 
with the insurance agency). You should look at those files BRIEFLY to familiarize yourself 
with them.

This module can get overwhelming if you panic and think too much about the big picture.  
Like a good software developer, you should focus on the specifications and do a little
at a time.  While these functions may seem like they require a lot of FAA knowledge, all
of the information you need is in the specifications. They are complex specifications,
but all of the information you need is there.  Combined with the provided unit tests
in tests.py, this assignment is very doable.

It may seem weird that these functions only check weather conditions at the time of 
takeoff and not the entire time the flight is in the air.  This is standard procedure 
for this insurance company.  The school is only liable if they let a pilot take off in 
the wrong conditions.  If the pilot stays up in adverse conditions, responsibility shifts 
to the pilot.

The preconditions for many of these functions are quite messy.  While this makes writing 
the functions simpler (because the preconditions ensure we have less to worry about), 
enforcing these preconditions can be quite hard. That is why it is not necessary to 
enforce any of the preconditions in this module.

def bad_visibility(visibility,minimum):
    """
    Returns True if the visibility measurement violates the minimum, False otherwise
    
    A valid visibility measurement is EITHER the string 'unavailable', or a dictionary 
    with (up to) four values: 'minimum', 'maximum',  'prevailing', and 'units'. Only 
    'prevailing' and 'units' are required; the other two are optional. The units may be 
    'FT' (feet) or 'SM' for (statute) miles, and explain how to interpret other three 
    fields, which are all floats.
    
    This function should compare ths visibility 'minimum' (if it exists) against the 
    minimum parameter. Else it compares the 'prevailing' visibility. This function returns
    True if minimum is more than the measurement. If the visibility is 'unavailable', 
    then this function returns True (indicating bad record keeping).
    
    Example: Suppose we have the following visibility measurement.

    REMEMBER: VFR flights are subject to minimums with VMC in the row while IFR flights 
    are subject to minimums with IMC in the row.  The examples above are all VFR flights.
    If we changed the second lesson to
    
        S00758, 548QR, I072, 2017-01-08T09:00:00-05:00, 2017-01-08T11:00:00-05:00, IFR, Pattern
    
    then it is possible it is no longer a visibility violation because it is subject to
    a different set of minimums.
