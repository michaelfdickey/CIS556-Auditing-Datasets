Module to check endorsement violations for a flight lesson (OPTIONAL)

There are three kinds of endorsement violations. (1) A student has not soloed
but flies without an instructor.  (2) A student flies a plane that he or she
has no endorsement for. (3) A student files an invalid IFR flight (which could
be for several reasons).

This module is actually no more difficult than violations.py (and can be quite
easy if you have finished that already).  This material was cut to make the
project shorter.  To implement this module, you need to familiarize yourself
with two files beyond what you have used already.

First, instructors.py is a CSV file with the following header:

    ID  LASTNAME  FIRSTNAME  CFI  CFII  MEI

This lists the instructors in the flight school. The first three columns are
general strings, while the last three columns are Yes/No strings. They indicate
whether the instructor can teach a student on a VFR flight, whether the
instructor can teach a student on an IFR flight, and whether the instructor
can teach a student on a multiengine flight.

Next, fleet.py is a CSV file with the following header:

    TAILNO  TYPE  CAPABILITY  ADVANCED  MULTIENGINE ANNUAL  HOURS

This lists the planes at the flight school.  The first three columns are
general strings.  The third column is one of the strings VFR/IFR, indicating
if the plane is outfitted for instrument flight.  The fourth and fifth columns
are Yes/No strings indicating the endorsments required for this plane.  The
last two columns may be ignored for this module.

The preconditions for many of these functions are quite messy.  While this
makes writing the functions simpler (because the preconditions ensure we have
less to worry about), enforcing these preconditions can be quite hard. That is
why it is not necessary to enforce any of the preconditions in this module.

def bad_endorsement(takeoff,student,instructor,plane):

    Returns True if the student or instructor did not have the right endorsement.
    
    The endorsement depends on the plane type (advanced, multiengine).  All
    instructors are certified for advanced planes, so a flight with an instructor
    is only a problem if the plane is multiengine and the instructor does not
    have an MEI.

    plane before the time of takeoff.

def bad_ifr(takeoff,student,instructor,plane):

    Returns True if the student, instructor, or plane is not certified for IFR.
    
    For an IFR flight to be valid, the plane must be outfitted for IFR.  If there
    is an instructor, that instructor must have a CFII. If the student is alone,
    the student must have an instrument rating at the time of takeoff.
    
    NOTE: The precondition for takeoff does not assume anything about the flight. 
    It may be a VFR flight not subject to IFR rules.  This function should still
    return False if that flight COULD have been a successful IFR flight.

    This function reads the data files in the given directory (the data files
    are all identified by the constants defined above in this module).  It loops
    through the list of flight lessons (in lessons.csv), identifying those
    takeoffs for which (1) a student has not soloed but flies without an instructor,

    This function returns a list that contains a copy of each violating lesson,
    together with the violation appended to the lesson.  Violation of type (1)
