Functions for parsing time values from text.  

While these functions are similar to functions found in the assignment, they 
are missing timezone information.  The next exercise will modify these 
functions to make them compatible with the assignment.

    timestamp to a datetime object.  If it is not a valid date (so the parser crashes), 
    this function should return None.

def sunset(date,daycycle):
    """
    Returns the sunset datetime (day and time) for the given date
    
    This function looks up the sunset from the given daycycle dictionary. If the
    daycycle dictionary is missing the necessary information, this function 
    returns the value None.
    
    A daycycle dictionary has keys for several years (as int).  The value for each year
    is also a dictionary, taking strings of the form 'mm-dd'.  The value for that key 
    is a THIRD dictionary, with two keys "sunrise" and "sunset".  The value for each of 
    those two keys is a string in 24-hour time format.
    
    For example, here is what part of a daycycle dictionary might look like:
        
        "2015": {
            "01-01": {
                "sunrise": "07:35",
                "sunset":  "16:44"
            },
            "01-02": {
                "sunrise": "07:36",
                "sunset":  "16:45"
            },
            ...
        }
    
    Parameter date: The date to check
    Precondition: date is a date object
    
    Parameter daycycle: The daycycle dictionary
    Precondition: daycycle is a valid daycycle dictionary, as described above

    # string in ISO format and call str_to_time.
